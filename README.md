# badbitch-rs

A full-spectrum **OSINT agent** in Rust — a port of the original `badbitch2.py`.
It drives a local LLM (via [Ollama](https://ollama.com)) through a tool-calling
loop to build intelligence dossiers on **authorized** targets (people,
properties, domains, infrastructure) from public records and openly accessible
sources, then saves and exports the result.

> **Authorized use only.** This is built for legitimate investigative work
> (your own assets, consented engagements, public-records research). Entity
> extraction is regex-based and conservative — treat everything it surfaces as
> *leads to corroborate against primary records*, never ground truth.

## Why Rust

The Python original works, but the Rust port is faster, has a single static
binary, real types around the tool/agent layer, and async I/O (Tokio + reqwest)
so recon fans out cleanly. The design doctrine is unchanged: **structured data
first** (prefer JSON APIs over scraping), every integration **degrades
gracefully** (a missing API key or CLI tells you exactly what to install), and a
**hard iteration cap + history compaction** keep long cases from blowing the
context window.

## Build & run

```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/badbitch                 # interactive REPL
./target/release/badbitch "123 Main St, City ST"   # single-shot, then exit
```

## GUI (`badbitch-gui`)

A native desktop control panel (egui), behind the opt-in `gui` feature:

```bash
cargo build --release --features gui --bin badbitch-gui
./target/release/badbitch-gui
```

- **Run** tab — enter a target, watch tool calls, per-turn perf + GPU/CPU split, and the
  final dossier stream in live, with a Quiet/Normal/Verbose filter.
- **Settings** tab — edit every param, pick a model from your installed Ollama models,
  a **Thinking: Default / On / Off** toggle, and the full set of Ollama generation options
  (num_ctx, temperature, top_k, min_p, mirostat, num_gpu, …). Saves to
  `~/.config/badbitch-rs/config.ini`.
- **Prompt** tab — view/edit the system prompt; save writes an override file, reset restores
  the built-in default.
- **🧠 Thought process** button — opens a second window showing the model's reasoning and
  every command it issues, with its own verbosity filter.

### CLI

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `badbitch` | interactive REPL (default) |
| `badbitch "<query>"` | single-shot query |
| `badbitch --list-tools` | list tools + which API keys / CLIs are live |
| `badbitch --list-cases` | list saved cases |
| `badbitch --show-case <id>` | print a saved dossier |
| `badbitch --export <id> [--out path.md]` | export a dossier to Markdown |
| `badbitch --init-config` | write a template `config.ini` |
| `-v`, `--verbose` | per-tool timing, retries, rate-limit waits |

In the REPL, `/reset` clears history + collected docs; `exit`/`quit` leaves.

## Setup

1. **Ollama + a model.** Install Ollama and pull a tool-capable model. The
   config defaults target a local abliterated/uncensored Qwen3 GGUF; any model
   with native tool-calls works, and the agent also recovers tool calls that
   weaker models leak as text.
2. **`badbitch --init-config`** → writes `~/.config/badbitch-rs/config.ini`. Fill in
   the `[api_keys]` you have (all optional). badbitch-rs is self-contained — its
   config, case DB (`~/.local/share/badbitch-rs/`), and logs live under their own
   namespace and never touch another tool's files.
3. **SearXNG** running locally for `web_search` (default
   `http://127.0.0.1:8888/search`).
4. **Optional CLIs** for the tools that shell out: `sherlock`, `holehe`,
   `theHarvester`, `phoneinfoga`, `exiftool`, `dig`/`whois`, and `python3` +
   Playwright for `fetch_rendered`. Each tool reports its own install hint when
   missing — see `--list-tools`.

### Configuration notes

- **Keys**: live in `config.ini` under `[api_keys]`. The file is gitignored.
- **`num_ctx`**: keep ≤ 20480 on a 12 GB GPU; past ~24576 the KV cache spills to
  RAM and output degrades. Compaction is token-aware, so a smaller window just
  prunes older turns sooner.
- **Separate DB**: the case store is a sibling `*_rs.sqlite` so it never clashes
  with the Python tool's cases.
- **Tor**: `[osint] tor = true` routes scraping through a SOCKS proxy. Off by
  default — many county/property sites block Tor exit nodes.

## Tools

`--list-tools` shows live status (✓ / ✗ no key / ✗ missing CLI). Grouped:

- **Recon / corpus** — `recon_sweep` (pre-flight: classify target, fan out
  searches, archive pages to disk), `web_search`, `collect`, `query_docs`,
  `read_doc`
- **Web fetch** — `fetch_rendered` (Playwright), `fetch_url`, `fetch_json`
- **People / social** — `people_search_links`, `social_search_links`,
  `sherlock`, `holehe`, `extract_contacts`
- **Entity / breach** — `theharvester`, `phoneinfoga`, `dehashed`,
  `rocketreach`, `opencorporates`, `breach_check` (HIBP)
- **Geo** — `geocode` (Nominatim), `imagery_links`, `suncalc` (chronolocation)
- **Property** — `find_county_portals`, `arcgis_query`, `attom_property`,
  `regrid_parcel`
- **Infra / domain** — `shodan`, `censys`, `dnsdumpster`, `virustotal`,
  `intelx`, `dns_recon`
- **Recovery / output** — `wayback`, `save_dossier`, `export_to_maltego`,
  `export_to_neo4j`
- **Links** — `reverse_image_links`, `crime_data_links`, `tor_status`
- **Shell** — `run_shell`, `python_eval`, `exif_metadata`

### Adding a tool

The `#[tool]` macro generates the schema + `Tool` impl from a typed async fn:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, JsonSchema)]
pub struct MyToolInput { pub target: String }

#[tool(name = "my_tool", description = "What it does and when to use it.")]
pub async fn my_tool(ctx: ToolContext, input: MyToolInput) -> String { /* … */ }
```

Then add `.route(my_mod::MyToolTool)` in `tool::toolset()`.

## Graph export (Maltego, Graphviz, Neo4j)

All exporters read the same saved case and build one shared graph model
(`badbitch/src/tool/graph.rs`), so they always agree — only the output differs.

**Relationship model** (richer than a plain star): a **subject anchor** linking
the primary person to every entity with a typed label; **derived `email→domain`**
edges; and **`domain↔IP` co-location** edges for entities sharing a source line.
Email local-parts are masked so they never leak in as Domain nodes.

- `export_to_maltego property_id="<id>"` (optional `graphviz=false`) →
  `<stem>.maltego.entities.csv`, `<stem>.maltego.links.csv`, and a Graphviz
  `<stem>.graphviz.dot` (+ `.png` when the `dot` CLI is installed).
- `export_to_neo4j property_id="<id>"` → `<stem>.neo4j.cypher`, idempotent
  `MERGE` statements (nodes Person/Email/Phone/Domain/IPv4; relationships
  `HAS_EMAIL`, `HAS_PHONE`, `ASSOCIATED_WITH`, `EMAIL_DOMAIN`, `CO_LOCATED`).
  Load with `cypher-shell -f <file>`.

For an interactive, click-to-expand workflow, `maltego_transforms/` ships
standalone [maltego-trx](https://github.com/MaltegoTech/maltego-trx) **local
transforms** sharing the exact same model (a Python port): expand a saved case,
expand any indicator across all cases, or extract entities from pasted text. See
`maltego_transforms/README.md`.

## Packaging (.deb)

Build a Debian/Ubuntu package that puts `badbitch` (CLI) and `badbitch-gui`
(desktop app, with an applications-menu launcher) on `PATH`, plus the
`badbitch-setup` helper:

```bash
./scripts/build-deb.sh                 # builds CLI + GUI → target/deb/badbitch_<ver>_<arch>.deb
sudo apt install ./target/deb/badbitch_*.deb
badbitch-setup                         # installs Ollama, pulls the model, adds
                                       # optional CLIs, writes the config
```

After install: launch **badbitch-rs** from your applications menu (or run
`badbitch-gui`), or use the `badbitch` CLI.

Or the one-shot from a source checkout (build → install → setup):

```bash
./scripts/install.sh
```

`badbitch-setup` honors `BADBITCH_MODEL=…` (override the model) and
`BADBITCH_SKIP_MODEL=1` (skip the multi-GB pull). The `.deb` declares the
apt-installable deps; Ollama, the model, SearXNG, and the pipx OSINT CLIs are
handled by the setup step because they can't be clean apt dependencies.

## Shell helpers (`bb3`, `bbc`)

`scripts/shell-aliases.sh` provides two conveniences — source it from your shell rc:

```bash
echo 'source ~/badbitch-rs/scripts/shell-aliases.sh' >> ~/.bashrc   # or ~/.zshrc
```

- **`bb3`** — launches the agent (alias for the installed `badbitch`).
- **`bbc [--hard]`** — frees RAM/VRAM for the local model, then opens `btop` (unless
  it's already running). Safe mode closes heavy desktop apps (browsers, Electron
  apps, Steam…); `--hard` TERMs every process you own except a protect-list. Either
  mode **never touches** the badbitch stack (Ollama, the agent, SearXNG + Docker, Tor,
  the tool CLIs), the desktop/session/network, or the terminal you ran it from. Edit
  `BBC_PROTECT` / the app list in the script to taste.

## Development

```bash
cargo test           # unit tests (extraction, relationship model, compaction…)
cargo clippy --tests # lint (the tree is kept warning-free)
cargo build
```
